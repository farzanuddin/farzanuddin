## Hello there! 

Hey! I’m Farzan, a React-focused front-end developer with over 6 years of experience building fast, scalable web apps.

My sweet spot is legacy migrations — I love taking messy, aging codebases and transforming them into clean, modern systems that teams actually enjoy working on. I also build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and help teams move forward with the right tech decisions.

I care a lot about great user experiences — intuitive interfaces, smooth interactions, and products that feel good to use.

If you’re into modern web tech, clean architecture, and building things the right way — we’ll get along great 😊🚀
